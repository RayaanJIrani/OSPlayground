# OSPlayground
Test the functionality of OS library in Python

#Goals
The objective of this repository is to be able to take a working .cpp file zipped in an input folder, unzip the file, compile the file and see if the file produces the correct output given a preditermined series of input. This task is mean to mimic the process of autograding some basic C++ programs using the OS library.

The C++ program I will be testing will take in a user input of an integer and print out two times that integer.
